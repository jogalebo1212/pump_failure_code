# pump_failure_code
Here, we will find a code that help us to find future information about electrical submersible pump. We have a signal that comes from these pump, and give us information about the possible failures that it could have.

However we make an algorithm to clean de data, find the anomalies, outliers and predict the future of these signal using ARIMA method and finally we just comment how predict failures using ML tools.
